## About This Project

This project is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional experience to potential employers and collaborators. It serves as a central hub for my work, built using fundamental web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and some basic JavaScript functionality to enhance user interaction and presentation.

## What I Learned

*   **Responsive Design Principles:** Mastering CSS Flexbox and Grid to create layouts that adapt seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes.
*   **Version Control (Git & GitHub):** Utilizing Git for tracking changes and collaborating, and using GitHub for hosting my project and managing deployments.
*   **Basic JavaScript DOM Manipulation:** Understanding how to select elements and modify the structure, style, and content of a webpage dynamically.

## Next Steps

If I had more time, I would incorporate a JavaScript framework, such as React, to rebuild the "Projects" section. This would allow for dynamic filtering and sorting of projects based on categories (e.g., 'HTML/CSS', 'JavaScript', 'Full Stack'), creating a more interactive and modern user experience.
